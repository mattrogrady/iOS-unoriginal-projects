# ios-learning-projects
This is a compilation of different iOS applications that I built while learning iOS development through udemy.com. 
***Please note that much of the material (image assets, app icons, base code) in some of these projects was downloaded from the course materials, and thus is not completely original. Said material is credited to The App Brewery***.
